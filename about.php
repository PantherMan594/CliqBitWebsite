		<p class="indent">Did we just get bored during our first year at college? Definitely not. We admittedly stumbled upon this idea while procrastinating studying for finals, but we couldn't give it up.</p>

			<p>In the winter of 2014, Hannah and Olivia stood at the bottom of a campus hill, doubled over in laughter they recounted the less than graceful moment that had just happened. On her way back from the dining hall, Hannah's feet came straight out from under her, her books flying out of her arms, and she proceeded to slip all the way down an icy hill. The fall was almost something out of a movie.</p>
			<p>To Hannah's surprise, the other witness was one of the only guys on their all-women’s campus — the handsome campus police officer. Of course. Surprise aside, they had one big regret: no one caught it on camera. And with status updates being outdated, there wasn't a place to share the moment with friends.</p>
			<p>This was the beginning of CliqBit.</p>
		</div>
		<p>There wasn't an ideal platform for sharing the brief, and funny moments that make up our lives.</p>
		<p>There are more professional networking sites, which aren't ideal for showcasing our funny sides.</p>
		<p>There are massively popular social networks, but everyone, including Grandma has found her way onto your wall. And Grandma is best not knowing some things.</p>
		<p>There are anonymous networking apps, but let's be honest, it's way more funny when you know who it happened to.</p>
		<p>In the end, there wasn't a platform designed to allow you to be yourself in all your personal, funny, candid glory. Until now.</p>

		<p class="centered">CliqBit is the humorous social media platform.</p>

				<p>A likely reason, though, is that employers are studying Facebook profiles almost as much as résumés.</p>

				<p>Frustrated with the lack of an ideal platform to share funny moments, Olivia Joslin and Hannah Wei, Wellesley ’18, created CliqBit. CliqBit is similar to Snapchat, allowing users to share their photos, videos, and posts with a specific group of friends for a limited timeframe that can range from only 5 seconds to as long as 48 hours... <a href="http://bcheights.com/metro/2016/new-app-cliqbit-seeks-to-create-a-positive-social-media-atmosphere/">Read more.</a></p>

				<p>CliqBit is a new kind of social media app that recently launched, and it combines elements of Facebook, Instagram and SnapChat. Most importantly, however, the app aims to shed the vanity and perfection that has come to dominate these social networks for many young people, especially women. Instead, the app wants to be a haven for the silly moments of your life. Beyond having some similar functionality to Facebook and other social networks, the app also lets you create your own memes and stop-motion videos... <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2016/02/12/new-mobile-apps-in-2016-made-by-boston-consumer-startups/">Read more.</a></p>

					<p>I use a lot of social media platforms, but I don’t always enjoy the time I spend on them. Ready to ditch the news and drama of other apps, Hannah and I started CliqBit to switch things up.</p>
					<p>Growing up, I was always known as the girl who giggled. I think I could find humor in just about anything, and I think CliqBit encourages us all to do the same. On average, everyone has 4-5 good laughs a day and it's time there was a place to share them. I’m looking forward to sharing my funny moments just much as I am to seeing yours! Cheers!</p>

						<h3>Fun(ny) facts:</h3>

							<li>I’m terrified of high ceilings.</li>
							<li>I’ve always wanted to be a racecar driver. I've also always wanted to live past the age of 20, so I'm glad I didn't choose this career path. I'm defintely not the world's best driver.</li>
							<li>I think I eat more dessert than regular food, which explains why I thought a donut would make an excellent Halloween costume. I dragged Hannah into my plan as well. You can't have just one donut.</li>

				<h2>Hannah Wei</h2>
				<h2>Co-Founder</h2>
				<p>Hannah Wei is the co-founder of CliqBIt and a student at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  Originally from Taiwan, she was encouraged to pursue a degree in STEM as early as third grade and published her first research paper in high school.</p>
				<p>In addition to studying Cinema & Media Studies with a pre-medical track, Hannah is pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Her studies have supported her work with the back-end infrastructure of the app, and she’s looking forward to tackling the unique challenges of being a woman in technology.</p>
				<p>Hannah is a certified lab researcher and a Red Cross lifeguard, and is fluent in four languages. She is passionate about helping others.</p>

					<p>I’ve always had a lot of silly moments. I’d be that one friend who flipped over her bike on a biking trip, and the one who scores the 'winning shot'—but in the wrong basket. I love making people laugh with my daily life, whether the people are my closest friends, new acquaintances, or even the special needs children I work with.</p>
					<p>In high school, I actually started an improv group to encourage people to laugh more at their everyday funny moments. CliqBit came about because Olivia and I really wanted to have a more suitable platform to comfortably share these hysterical moments with our friends and to avoid missing out on everyone’s life bloopers (#endFOMO)!</p>
					<p>If you can’t tell already, we love CliqBit, and we hope you will soon, too!</p>
					<div class="funFacts">
						<h3>Fun(ny) facts:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>I have a long list of irrational fears, including high-pressure cookers and potential-snakes-in-the-toilet.</li>
							<li>I'm fluent in 4 languages, which essentially means that it takes me a while to switch language modes when texting.</li>
							<li>I have a detached retina in my right eye. Often I can only detect light like I’m an earthworm with an eyespot. So life is pretty exciting for me.</li>
