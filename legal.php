		<h2 class="centered">CliqBit™ Terms of Service</h2>
		<p class="centered">Effective date: December 5, 2015</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
		<p>The following are the CliqBit™ Terms of Service (“Terms”) for the use of any CliqBit™ applications. Please read the Terms carefully. By downloading, accessing, or using the applications, websites, or other products or services of CliqBit™, LLC (“CliqBit™”, “we” or “us”), or the services, features, or functionality jointly offered with other companies through our application or website (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
		<p>These Terms affect your legal rights and obligations, if you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use any CliqBit™ Applications or Services. In the event you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern as to the respective party’s relationship with you. In these instances, we will take steps to make the third party’s terms available to you before you begin to use the service, feature, or functionality.</p>
		<p>CliqBit™ is not a money-services business. It does not transmit any funds. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, subject to their terms of use.</p>
		<p>Arbitration Notice: Except for certain types of disputes described in the arbitration clause below, you agree that disputes between you and CliqBit™, LLC will be resolved by mandatory, binding arbitration and by using the Services, you waive any right to enter into a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Have a sense of humor</h3>
		<p>Our Terms of Service form a proper legal contract. The majority of the Services have been developed to allow our users to share humor and to observe and even participate with the humor of others. Everyone has his or her own sense of humor. So, please be aware of others’ sensitivity and enjoy this application in the positive manner in which it has been developed. Our Terms of Service allow us to continue to improve our applications, while at the same time ensuring that a few inappropriate users don’t ruin everyone else’s experience with the Services. Use your common sense: Keep posting your humorous “Bits” to your “Cliqs”, and please do not post items that others won’t want to see.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Our Users</h3>
		<p>CliqBit™ is for the use of people who are at least 13 years old. Persons under the age of 13 are prohibited from creating CliqBit™ accounts. Some Services may be subject to separate terms from CliqBit™ or third parties that contain further age requirements. If you are under 18 and use those Services, you may be violating the third party’s governing terms, which we deem a violation of these Terms, as well.</p>
		<p>Before using the Services, you must affirm that you are either at least 13 years of age and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, and to abide by and comply with these Terms. In addition, you will be asked to affirm that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Services and do not have more than one CliqBit™ account.</p>
		<p>CliqBit™ may, at its sole discretion, refuse to offer or allow Services to any person or entity. We may, without notice and at CliqBit’s sole discretion, terminate your right to use the Services, or any portion thereof, and may also block or prevent your future access to and use of the Services or any portion thereof.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Privacy</h3>
		<p>The CliqBit™ Privacy Policy can be accessed by clicking <a href="#privacy">here</a> and is incorporated into these Terms. By using the Services and/or agreeing to these Terms, you agree to the collection, use, and sharing of your information through the Services in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>User Content</h3>
		<p>The Services consist of interactive features and areas of the CliqBit™ applications that allow users to create, post, transmit, and/or store content, including but not limited to posts, photos, videos, text, graphics, links, or other materials (collectively, “User Content”). You are responsible for all third party data charges that you incur when using the Services. Keep in mind that your User Content may be viewable by others and that you have the ability to control who can access your user content by designating what CliqBit™ feed your information is on and for how long. Users who post to their “Cliqs” should be aware that the group manager, known as a “Cliq’r”, may add new people to the Cliq at their discretion. It is your responsibility to stay updated on the membership changes that inherently occur within each Cliq. You have the option to leave a Cliq if you are dissatisfied with member(s) in the Cliq for any reason.</p>
		<p>It’s important to be aware that any information shared online may be accessed by others. CliqBit™, LLC is not responsible for the actions of those who obtain the content that you have chosen to share.

When you submit User Content to CliqBit™ in connection with any and all postings as well as any other crowd-sourced information, you agree to give CliqBit™ the right to sublicense such User Content (including your name, likeness and voice) to other companies, organizations, or individuals in connection with the operation of CliqBit™, promotion, syndication, distribution, broadcast, or publication of CliqBit and other crowd-sourced postings in all distribution methods or media outlets. No use of User Content, including without limitation, CliqBit™ postings, and other crowd-sourced information, entitles you to compensation from CliqBit™, or any other companies, organizations, or individuals.</p>
		<p>While CliqBit ™is not obligated to do so, it reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to review, screen, and delete any User Content at any time and for any reason.</p>
		<br>

			<li>
				Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury; Confidentiality of Arbitration PLEASE READ THE PARAGRAPHS BELOW CAREFULLY. THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES WITH CLIQBIT™, AND LIMIT THE METHODS IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CLIQBIT™.
				<div class="indent" style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<p>Arbitration Agreement. Any and all claims, disagreements and disputes relating to, arising from and/or connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by CliqBit™ that cannot come to a resolution informally, shall be resolved by binding arbitration under the terms set forth in the section titled “Arbitration Agreement”. With the exception that CliqBit™ is not required to arbitrate any dispute in which CliqBit™ seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of CliqBit’s patents, logos, trade names, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and CliqBit™, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, successors, and assignors.</p>
					<p>Rules of Arbitration. The interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration process is governed by The Federal Arbitration Act. All dispute arbitrations must be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers binding arbitration as set forth in this section. The rules of the ADR shall govern all aspects of the binding arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration (“Arbitration Rules”). The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration can be found on their website at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. All arbitrations shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator located in the State of South Carolina.</p>
					<p>The Arbitrator’s Authority. At the arbitrator’s sole discretion, they will determine the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and CliqBit™. There will be no consolidation of any disputes with any other parties, cases and/or similar matters. The arbitrator shall have the full and sole authority to grant motions dismissing of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the sole authority to award fiscal damages and to grant any non-fiscal remedy or relief available to CliqBit™, LLC or an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall be required to issue a written statement of the decision describing the award and all the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including, but not limited to, the methodology, calculation and details of any fiscal and non-fiscal damages awarded. The arbitrator holds the same authority as a judge in a court of law to award relief on an individual basis. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding upon you and CliqBit™.</p>
					<p>Jury Trial Waiver. You and CliqBit™ hereby waive any statutory and constitutional rights to resolve a dispute or claim by having a trial in front of a judge or jury. You are authorizing that such claims and disputes shall be fully and completely resolved by binding arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. In the event any litigation should result between you and CliqBit™ in any federal or state court in a lawsuit to enforce or vacate an arbitration award or otherwise, you and CliqBit™ waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
					<p>Waiver of Consolidated and Class Actions. All disputes and claims within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement may not be arbitrated or litigated on a class basis. All claims of more than one user or client cannot be arbitrated or litigated together or combined with those of any other user or client. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, in the event that this section is ruled invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor CliqBit™, LLC are entitled to arbitration and instead all claims and disputes shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina or in a court located in the State of South Carolina.</p>
					<p>Confidentiality of Arbitration. The procedures shall not be open or disclosed to the media or the public. Any and all evidence submitted or discovered for the arbitration hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement by CliqBit™, LLC, pursuant to court order or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the before mentioned, neither party shall be prevented from filing to a court of law any and information required to enforce this Arbitration Agreement or to enforce an arbitration award.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Applicable Law Any dispute between you and CliqBit™ will be governed by these Terms and the laws of the State of South Carolina and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</li>
			<li>Severability If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</li>
			<li>Complete Agreement These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete agreement between you and CliqBit™. These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. We may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion without notice to you. Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services and delete your CliqBit™ account.</li>

		<h2 class="centered">CliqBit™ Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p class="centered">Effective date: November 30th, 2015</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>What’s Up</h3>
		<p>CliqBit™ is a social platform to share humorous moments with other friends, followers, and groups or “Cliqs”. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what data is generated from your CliqBit™ account and what is done with that information. When you post comments, pictures and video on CliqBit™, you agree that we are providing a platform that may be seen by others and where data will be collected by CliqBit™ consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and with our Terms of Service Policy, which can be found on this page and at this link: <a href="legal">https://cliqbitapp.com/legal</a></p>
		<br>
		<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
		<p>This is an overview detailing how CliqBit™ account information is used. There are three criteria of information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>User identity information provided by you when you set up your user account</li>
			<li>Application usage information generated from your activity on CliqBit™</li>
			<li>Use of your information by third parties</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>User Identity Information</h3>
		<p>The data you share with us when creating a CliqBit™ account such as a user name, password, identifying image, email address, and date of birth is information you provide when setting up your account. This information marks your identity on CliqBit™, ensures that you are a human being of appropriate age, and assists other users in finding you.</p>
		<p>CliqBit™ provides you with the option of choosing “Private Account” in your Account Settings. This feature allows your account to only be viewable by those following you, and in the future asks your permission before others may begin following your account and viewing your posts.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Application usage information</h3>
		<p>As you utilize the different features of CliqBit™, you generate data on how you interact with the services and other users on CliqBit™. This information, such as usage frequency, “Cliqs” joined, and number of followers helps CliqBit™ to understand how the app is working, and where it may require some improvements or updates. </p>
		<p>To better understand CliqBit™ usage and to target new features, we identify your device type, operating system version and network connection. This specific device information is not linked to your account, but rather it is summarized for trending and analysis.</p>
		<p>The user content information you generate by using CliqBit™, such as pictures, videos, and posts are stored on our servers for a period of time. See “Information Storage” section for further information. </p>
		<p>CliqBit™ provides you with the option to “Share My Location” in your user settings. This allows CliqBit™ to offer location based features within the application, such as showing a map of where group posts come from. For safety reasons CliqBit™ will not disclose your specific location within the application without your permission. CliqBit™ may, at times, anonymize and aggregate your information into summary data by zip code, city, state or country.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Use of your information by third parties</h3>
		<p>Third Parties may be used to gather data about your interaction with our service, to process transactions or to perform analyses of our services. We may share this information with such organizations as, (but not limited to) outside service providers and their affiliates, researchers, and legal entities (when pertinent or required). These third parties may be given your personal information needed to perform the services that CliqBit™ has engaged them to perform. These third party organizations will not be allowed to utilize your personal data for purposes other than to perform the services that they were engaged to provide.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
		<p>Our main purpose in collecting information is to ensure CliqBit™ is fulfilling user needs and providing enhancements to keep our users smiling. Specifically, we:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Verify user identities and prevent unauthorized activities, security breaches or fraud</li>
			<li>Maintain and enhance the functionality of CliqBit™</li>
			<li>Analyze CliqBit™ usage and trends</li>
			<li>Communicate with and assist users</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information in a local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster. Storing certain information on your device locally improves the performance of the application and optimizes and limits data you must download to your device.</p>
		<p>In the event that CliqBit™ becomes part of another organization through a company merger or acquisition, your CliqBit™ user data may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>It’s On You</h3>
		<p>Information you share on CliqBit™ may be accessed by users who you designate can see your posts, whether it is in the main feed or within your 5 “Cliqs”. It’s important to be aware that any information shared online may be accessed by others. CliqBit™, LLC is not responsible for the actions of those who obtain the content that you have chosen to share.</p>
		<p>Please protect your account safety and your privacy by maintaining the secrecy of your account information and password at all times.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Party Invites</h3>
		<p>You can choose to expand your “Cliqs” by “Inviting Friends to CliqBit™” from your Settings screen. When you choose “Find Friends to Follow” a message tells you that your contacts are periodically synced and stored on our servers. CliqBit™ provides you with the option to either choose “Ok”, or “Don’t Allow”. </p>
		<p>You may also invite friends to CliqBit™ by choosing the “Search” option within the service, and choosing “Connect With Facebook Friends”. Facebook is a third-party service and information provided to us from outside services is not governed by this Privacy Policy until it is received by CliqBit™.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Information Storage</h3>
		<p>The CliqBit™ feature for disappearing feed allow pictures, videos and posts to move quickly. For the most part, messages sent through CliqBit™ servers will be deleted and/or written over at an undetermined period of time after the content has been set as either a 5 second or 48 hour post. The exception to this is when users choose a permanent feed.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that CliqBit™ cannot guarantee that data will be deleted in a certain period of time. There are instances when data backup must adhere to certain legal guidelines, or when law enforcement requires an exception. As with any device, it’s important to know there are means to pull data off temporary storage on users’ devices, or to resurrect deleted information from a device.</p>
		<p>Finally, you can delete your account at any time. However, we may retain your account information for a reasonable time for audit, backup and archival reasons. Information that others have posted about you, and is not solely associated with your account, will not be deleted when your account is closed.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Play Nice</h3>
		<p>CliqBit™, LLC reserves the right to disable your account if we detect that the property and safety of CliqBit™ or its users, is being abused.</p>
